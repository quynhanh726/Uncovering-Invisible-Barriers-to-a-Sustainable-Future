Humans have been fascinated by the anglerfish for a long time (check out this engraving from 1893). But how did this deep sea predator first evolve? New research sheds light on the bathypelagic fish's evolutionary history.Getty Imageshide caption
June 4, 2025 •There are over 200 species of deep-sea anglerfish; some are long and thin, some are squat and round, some have fins that they use to ""walk"" along the sea floor, and others have huge eyes set far back into their heads. But how did all this morphological diversity first come to be? Thanks to a new anglerfish family tree, now we know.

Sailors have reported mysterious ""milky seas,"" or miles-long glowing patches of ocean for centuries. Some researchers have created a database to figure out why they glow.Steven D. Miller/CIRA/CSU and NOAA/NESDIShide caption
June 2, 2025 •For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during moonless nights. This phenomenon is known as ""milky seas,"" but the only scientific sample was collected in 1985. So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

May 30, 2025 •Depending on what time it is, your body responds differently to an injury or infection. During the day, you're likely to heal faster and fight infection better than at night. And historically, scientists weren't entirely sure why. That picture is starting to clear up thanks to a new study published last week in the journalScience Immunology.The research finds a missing piece of the puzzle in neutrophils, powerful immune cells that — despite living less than 24 hours — know the difference between day and night.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption
The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.
""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this,"" says Oleksandr, the plant manager at a Ukrainian power station. ""After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Former President Jimmy Carter  fishes for native rainbow trout on Turniptown Creek, near his mountain cabin near Ellijay, Ga., May 23, 1988. Carter signed legislation that doubled the size of the National Park System.
Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.

Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.Jimmy Carter Libraryhide caption
Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

Panama has been looking for solutions to a long-term problem. Every time a ship passes through the Panama Canal, more than 50 million gallons of fresh water from Lake Gatun pour out into the ocean.Nobody ever thought Panama could run out of water. It is one of the rainiest countries in the world. But a couple years ago, a drought got so bad that the canal had to reduce traffic by more than a third - which had a huge impact on global shipping.The Panama Canal needs more water.  Authorities have decided to get it by building a dam in a spot that would displace more than 2,000 people along the Rio Indio.For sponsor-free episodes ofConsider This,sign up for Consider This+via Apple Podcasts or atplus.npr.orgEmail us atconsiderthis@npr.org

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.
""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this,"" says Oleksandr, the plant manager at a Ukrainian power station. ""After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

June 2, 2025 •For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during moonless nights. This phenomenon is known as ""milky seas,"" but the only scientific sample was collected in 1985. So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

It's been six months since President Trump first announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency initiative, which has dramatically shrunk parts of the federal government. And with so many individual stories about federal workers losing their jobs around the country, the big picture can sometimes look blurry.
A team of NPR reporters has been looking at agencies — from food inspectors to nuclear scientists to firefighters and more — and today, we'll connect some of the dots on how DOGE cuts have impacted workers, and hear how Americans far beyond Washington may feel the effects of these cuts.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""

But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption
The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.

He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

A flare burns natural gas at an oil well in Watford City, N.D. in 2021. Oil and natural gas companies would have to pay a fee for methane emissions that exceed certain levels under a new rule announced by the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday.Matthew Brown/APhide caption
Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Sailors have reported mysterious ""milky seas,"" or miles-long glowing patches of ocean for centuries. Some researchers have created a database to figure out why they glow.Steven D. Miller/CIRA/CSU and NOAA/NESDIShide caption
June 2, 2025 •For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during moonless nights. This phenomenon is known as ""milky seas,"" but the only scientific sample was collected in 1985. So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption
The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.

Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Former President Jimmy Carter  fishes for native rainbow trout on Turniptown Creek, near his mountain cabin near Ellijay, Ga., May 23, 1988. Carter signed legislation that doubled the size of the National Park System.
Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, explains how solar panels work to sons Thomas, right, and Henry, left. This was at a Feb. 8, 2017 ribbon cutting ceremony for a solar panel project on farmland Jimmy Carter owned in his hometown of Plains, Ga.
In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

A flare burns natural gas at an oil well in Watford City, N.D. in 2021. Oil and natural gas companies would have to pay a fee for methane emissions that exceed certain levels under a new rule announced by the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday.Matthew Brown/APhide caption
Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.

Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

Panama has been looking for solutions to a long-term problem. Every time a ship passes through the Panama Canal, more than 50 million gallons of fresh water from Lake Gatun pour out into the ocean.Nobody ever thought Panama could run out of water. It is one of the rainiest countries in the world. But a couple years ago, a drought got so bad that the canal had to reduce traffic by more than a third - which had a huge impact on global shipping.The Panama Canal needs more water.  Authorities have decided to get it by building a dam in a spot that would displace more than 2,000 people along the Rio Indio.For sponsor-free episodes ofConsider This,sign up for Consider This+via Apple Podcasts or atplus.npr.orgEmail us atconsiderthis@npr.org

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

Chris Wright on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, Jan. 12, 2018.Lucas Jackson/Reutershide caption
President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

Wind turbines of South Fork Wind are seen off the coast of Block Island, R.I., on Oct. 9, 2024.Seth Wenig/APhide caption
A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

It's been six months since President Trump first announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency initiative, which has dramatically shrunk parts of the federal government. And with so many individual stories about federal workers losing their jobs around the country, the big picture can sometimes look blurry.
A team of NPR reporters has been looking at agencies — from food inspectors to nuclear scientists to firefighters and more — and today, we'll connect some of the dots on how DOGE cuts have impacted workers, and hear how Americans far beyond Washington may feel the effects of these cuts.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.

He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

June 2, 2025 •For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during moonless nights. This phenomenon is known as ""milky seas,"" but the only scientific sample was collected in 1985. So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

May 30, 2025 •Depending on what time it is, your body responds differently to an injury or infection. During the day, you're likely to heal faster and fight infection better than at night. And historically, scientists weren't entirely sure why. That picture is starting to clear up thanks to a new study published last week in the journalScience Immunology.The research finds a missing piece of the puzzle in neutrophils, powerful immune cells that — despite living less than 24 hours — know the difference between day and night.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption
The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.Jimmy Carter Libraryhide caption
Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.

Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.

Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, explains how solar panels work to sons Thomas, right, and Henry, left. This was at a Feb. 8, 2017 ribbon cutting ceremony for a solar panel project on farmland Jimmy Carter owned in his hometown of Plains, Ga.
In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Chris Wright on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, Jan. 12, 2018.Lucas Jackson/Reutershide caption
President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

A flare burns natural gas at an oil well in Watford City, N.D. in 2021. Oil and natural gas companies would have to pay a fee for methane emissions that exceed certain levels under a new rule announced by the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday.Matthew Brown/APhide caption
Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.

Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

Workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant are repairing the facility after rocket strikes to restore power as temperatures drop, Oct. 4.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

Panama has been looking for solutions to a long-term problem. Every time a ship passes through the Panama Canal, more than 50 million gallons of fresh water from Lake Gatun pour out into the ocean.Nobody ever thought Panama could run out of water. It is one of the rainiest countries in the world. But a couple years ago, a drought got so bad that the canal had to reduce traffic by more than a third - which had a huge impact on global shipping.The Panama Canal needs more water.  Authorities have decided to get it by building a dam in a spot that would displace more than 2,000 people along the Rio Indio.For sponsor-free episodes ofConsider This,sign up for Consider This+via Apple Podcasts or atplus.npr.orgEmail us atconsiderthis@npr.org

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.
""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this,"" says Oleksandr, the plant manager at a Ukrainian power station. ""After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

Across Ukraine, workers continue the seemingly Sisyphean task of repairing power plants after each Russian attack.
At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""

Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

He says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

Wind turbines of South Fork Wind are seen off the coast of Block Island, R.I., on Oct. 9, 2024.Seth Wenig/APhide caption
A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.

He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

June 2, 2025 •For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during moonless nights. This phenomenon is known as ""milky seas,"" but the only scientific sample was collected in 1985. So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

It's been six months since President Trump first announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency initiative, which has dramatically shrunk parts of the federal government. And with so many individual stories about federal workers losing their jobs around the country, the big picture can sometimes look blurry.
A team of NPR reporters has been looking at agencies — from food inspectors to nuclear scientists to firefighters and more — and today, we'll connect some of the dots on how DOGE cuts have impacted workers, and hear how Americans far beyond Washington may feel the effects of these cuts.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""

But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment.

Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption
The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

At the DTEK plant visited by NPR, shattered windows are patched up with tarp. Buildings are scorched, with holes caused by missile shrapnel. Crews instead are focused only on fixing the equipment the plant needs to operate.

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.

He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

May 30, 2025 •Depending on what time it is, your body responds differently to an injury or infection. During the day, you're likely to heal faster and fight infection better than at night. And historically, scientists weren't entirely sure why. That picture is starting to clear up thanks to a new study published last week in the journalScience Immunology.The research finds a missing piece of the puzzle in neutrophils, powerful immune cells that — despite living less than 24 hours — know the difference between day and night.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption
The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption
Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" Maksym Timchenko, CEO of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said in a recent statement.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.

Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.
Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, explains how solar panels work to sons Thomas, right, and Henry, left. This was at a Feb. 8, 2017 ribbon cutting ceremony for a solar panel project on farmland Jimmy Carter owned in his hometown of Plains, Ga.
In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.

Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

Nearby, another crew in heavy protective gear is repairing the plant's outdoor switchyard, which connects the station to the transmission network. The crew's leader, Andriy, asks NPR's team to stay back to avoid getting electrocuted.
""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation. (TheZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which generated about a quarter of Ukraine's electricity supply before Russia's 2022 invasion, is under Russian control.) DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

A flare burns natural gas at an oil well in Watford City, N.D. in 2021. Oil and natural gas companies would have to pay a fee for methane emissions that exceed certain levels under a new rule announced by the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday.Matthew Brown/APhide caption
Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""

June 2, 2025 •For hundreds of years sailors have told stories about miles of glowing ocean during moonless nights. This phenomenon is known as ""milky seas,"" but the only scientific sample was collected in 1985. So atmospheric scientist Justin Hudson, a PhD candidate at Colorado State University, used accounts spanning 400 years to create a database of milky seas. By also using satellite images to visually confirm the tales, Justin hopes his research brings us one step closer to unraveling this maritime mystery.

Lindsey Williamson learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on a home improvement television show. However, ""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption
WHITTIER, Calif. — After replacing her gas car with an electric one and installing solar panels on her century-old house, Lindsey Williamson and her husband were looking for more ways to reduce their climate pollution.
""We just started thinking, what are the next things that we could change out, from gas to electric?"" Williamson says. She learned about efficient heat pump water heaters on the home improvement television showThis Old Houseand decided that was their best option.
Williamson says she called contractors. Some claimed to have never heard of a heat pump water heater, while others tried to convince her to install another gas water heater. Only one installer came to her house, but then she says he ""essentially, just like, ghosted us.""
""My main problem was finding somebody locally who could actually install what I was looking for,"" Williamson says.
Enough people are having the same experience that companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies are offering help. They're also helping homeowners and renters navigate confusing government incentives for purchasing cleaner appliances. Think of it as a climate coach.
Converting from natural gas to electric appliances in your home can reduce your contribution to climate change, especially for big energy users like a furnace or water heater.Nearly a thirdof the United States' greenhouse gases that are heating the planet come from the energy used in buildings. Burning fossil fuel gas in appliances is one of the biggest sources.
That's whyelectrification — switching from gas to electric — is a key climate solution. Appliances are powered by electricity that's generated from anincreasingly cleaner grid.
And there are indications these electric appliances are becoming more popular. Heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. since 2021,according to the energy transition group RMI. And Consumer Reports found in a2022 surveythat while only 3% of respondents had an induction stove in their kitchen at the time, ""almost 70 percent of people said they might or would consider induction for their next range or cooktop.""
In Williamson's search for an installer in the Los Angeles area, she came acrossQuitCarbon's website. The startup operates only in California for now, but plans to expand nationwide. Itvets contractors, first by making sure they won't try and talk a customer out of converting from gas to electric. The firm also checks out reviews and references before matching contractors with customers. If the customer chooses that installer, QuitCarbon earns a commission.
QuitCarbon launched in 2022 after CEO and ""Chief Quitter"" Cooper Marcus hired an expensive consultant to make climate-friendly changes to his San Francisco Victorian home. ""Walking down the street in my neighborhood, looking at my neighbors homes,"" Marcus says it occurred to him, ""Wow, if the route from here to a fossil-free society runs through a multi-thousand dollar plan — just the plan — for each home, then we are screwed.""
Marcus says he created his company to solve this problem. He thinks of the business as a decarbonization ""coach"" that helps people navigate the confusing transition to a home with cleaner energy.
Williamson says QuitCarbon found her a contractor, who was willing to install a new heat pump water heater within a few weeks. It was more expensive than a gas model but she expected that.
""We've done the math, like on an Excel spreadsheet,"" Williamson says, and the water heater will save money on her utility bills over the long-term by using less energy.
She says QuitCarbon also identified available government incentives, which reduced the cost. ""That was an added bonus,"" she says, ""I'm not a tax person, so I didn't really know too much about that.""
Marcus says the company closely tracks incentives — what's available now, when they expire and what's coming. ""We can advise our clients, perhaps, to wait,"" he says. ""You're thinking about this upgrade, but if you just hold off a little while, we can help you get more free money from the government.""
A few states offer services to residents that ease the transition from gas to electric appliances. In Maine there's the quasi-state agency theEfficiency Maine Trust.
""We are entirely focused on the consumer experience,"" says Michael Stoddard, executive director. He says the goal is to create a lot of demand for more efficient appliances by making them easier to buy. ""We're not interested in just doing ten or 20 of these or 100 or 200. We need to do hundreds of thousands — converting these homes from imported, expensive, dirty fuels to high efficiency, clean electrical systems.""
Efficiency Maine's website answers basic questions about how an appliance works, what's available and how much they cost. Stoddard says in some cases customers don't even have to apply for incentives — suppliers and stores take care of that.
""We've worked out the financial arrangements with them behind the scenes,"" he says. ""So you just go to the store, you buy the thing, and instantaneously the price is marked down to reflect that incentive.""
Stoddard says by focusing on demand for cleaner appliances, the rest of the local marketplace aligns behind that. ""When customers start buying hundreds of thousands of heat pumps, heat pump suppliers will hire more workers and they will pay to train them,"" he says.
Part of creating that demand is ensuring customers have information about more efficient appliances when they need it.
""Most of the time, when people have the conversation about needing to replace their water heater, it's because the shower is cold in the morning,"" says Ari Matusiak, president and CEO of Rewiring America. If they haven't already done research on cleaner appliances, he says that puts them at an information disadvantage when they need to make a quick decision.
His groupoffers advice, includinghow to plan for electric appliancesandwhat renters can do. Rewiring America also is training volunteers to help households get the information needed to choose more climate-friendly appliances.
""We've started anelectrification coaches program, which are basically volunteers — a lot of retired engineers and people who are just committed,"" Matusiak says. They attend a four-week training, so they have the technical knowledge to help consumers.
""We've trained 1,100 people around the country, over the course of the last year or so,"" Matusiak says. But with 132 million U.S. households, there's also a big demand for this kind of help.

An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.
The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change.
The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization ""is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.""
The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says.
""People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'"" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said.
Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues.
Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as ""an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.""
But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time.
Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use.
The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star.
The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that ""would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.""
The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.
The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.
Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash.
""For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,"" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. ""When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.""

A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.
Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.
""This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are ""using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,"" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.
""The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,"" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were ""alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting"" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.
The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.
Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.
Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a ""national energy emergency,"" which called for expanding domestic energy production.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.
Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.
Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind.
The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.
Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

BARCELONA, Spain — A major power outage hit Spain and Portugal on Monday, including their capitals, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines.
It is rare to have such a widespread outage there. Spanish generator Red Eléctrica said it affected the Iberian peninsula and the incident is being assessed.
The countries have a combined population of over 50 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected.
Spain's public broadcaster RTVE said a major power outage hit several regions of the country just after midday local time, leaving its newsroom, Spain's parliament in Madrid and subway stations across the country in the dark.
A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500MW to near 15,000MW.
A couple of hours later, Spain's electricity network operator said it was recovering power in the north and south of the peninsula, which would help to progressively restore the electricity supply nationwide.
In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country.
Portugal's government said the incident appeared to stem from problems outside the country, an official told national news agency Lusa.
""It looks like it was a problem with the distribution network, apparently in Spain. It's still being ascertained,"" Cabinet Minister Leitão Amaro was quoted as saying.
Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem with the European electricity system,"" according to Portuguese newspaper Expresso. The company said it was compelled to cut power in specific areas to stabilize the network, according to Expresso.
E-Redes said parts of France also were affected.
Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected. Traffic lights in Lisbon stopped working.
It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks, though some apps were working.

Scott Rabinowitz, president of Grand Resources, stands near a pump jack in Sperry, Okla., on March 20, 2024.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
A century ago, in one small patch of Oklahoma, Texaco drilled an oil well.
At first, the oil surged toward the surface as if it was desperate for air, propelled by the underground pressure that had built up over millennia. Then — as always — the torrent slowed. The aging well changed hands several times.
""A reservoir is like a balloon,"" says Scott Robinowitz, the independent operator who owns the field now. ""Take the oil out and there's less pressure to drive oil gas and water to the wellbore.""
There's still oil underground. It's just hard to get out.
These are the forces that shape an old oil well: The laws of physics and the realities of geology, pinching the flow to a dribble. And working against them, the phenomenal wealth that oil can bring, incentivizing operators to squeeze out every drop they can.
The vast majority of America's oil wells are, like this one, past their prime. From one perspective, these wells are assets, money-makers, opportunities. From another, they're a problem: a compounding environmental debt. Older wells can release a planet-warming gas, methane — and someday, they'll all have to be closed.
The United States makes an enormous amount of oil — more than any other country, ever. But that boom is driven by new, abundant oil wells. On average, every new well drilled in the U.S. makes more than a thousand barrels of oil per day.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of active wells — 77 percent of them, according tothe latest government numbers— make less than 15 barrels per day. That's hundreds of thousands of wells, cumulatively making less than 6% of the country's oil and natural gas.
Aging, low-volume oil wells are often calledmarginal wellsbecause they're ""marginally economic,"" only barely making money. They're also known as stripper wells — they're ""stripping"" the remaining oil from the ground.
Whatever you call them, Robinowitz specializes in them. He owns hundreds, including the Bird Creek field that was first drilled by Texaco. (Texaco ceased operations as an oil company in 2001, but exists today as a brand owned by Chevron.)
According to Robinowitz and a 1966 geology paper, this field was something of a laboratory for Texaco. They pioneered processes now standard in the industry: injecting water underground to increase the pressure. Injecting steam. Injecting hot air. Using underground fires to reinvigorate the wells.
Eventually, these wells passed to Robinowitz. Today, he's still experimenting, applying newer innovations like horizontal drilling to extend the old wells' lifespans — even reviving wells that other operators had dismissed.
He breaks down the economics of how it works. Consider one particular well that makes four barrels of oil per day. (Once refined, that could fill up three SUVs with gas and about a third of a semi's tank with diesel.)
It took him $150,000 of work to redrill the well, adding a horizontal turn to increase its production to that four-barrel level. It costs about $1,000 every month to run it, between service, repairs and the electricity for the pump.
That's a lot of money up front for a little bit of oil. But the well will keep making four barrels a day for many years. Based on the average oil price for 2024, that well was bringing in more than $6,000 every month.
That's not all profit: Robinowitz still has to pay for expenses, including new projects and office overhead. But that's thousands of dollars of income each month from one well, and he has hundreds of wells. ""It works,"" Robinowitz says.
One reason it works is because of an array of supportive government policies.
A tax rule called ""percentage depletion"" allows independent producers like Robinowitz — butnotbig, diversified oil companies — to automatically deduct a big chunk of revenue from their taxes. It'sa multibillion dollar breakthat overwhelmingly benefits the nation's marginal well owners.
One tax professor has found archival records suggesting the benefit was created in part because ofa mistake— but it has beenpassionately defendedover the years by the National Stripper Well Association, which represents marginal well operators.
""We're in the hospice end of the business,"" Ken Hunter, the former chairman of the NSWA, said in an interview last year. ""Our job essentially is to extend the life of the well as long as we can."" And percentage depletion, he said, does exactly that: Extends the economic lifespan of wells.
Additionaltax breaks for marginal wellskick in when oil prices drop below a certain level. And many states have made stripper wellsexemptfrom state taxes on oil production.
The base of one of Scott Robinowitz's marginal wells shows built-up oil. The wells produce just a few barrels a day, but that small volume can still be profitable. Keeping operating costs low is key to making money on marginal wells, creating tension between environmental groups who want more active monitoring for pollution risks and companies that want to keep costs down.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
Historically, federal and state governments have seen keeping old wells open as an economic and national security imperative. The alternative, letting wells be permanently closed, would waste a natural resource and increase reliance on foreign crude.
Hunter pointed out that oil and gas wells are distributed widely across the U.S., and are an ""economic lifeline"" to their rural communities. And he argued for a broader benefit: ""It is kind of a backup national resource for, you know, in times of war or something along those lines,"" he said. ""It's strength, to be in control of your own destiny and not have to wait for an oil tanker to arrive into a port.""
But environmental groups have been pushing for regulators to view the costs and benefits differently.
""Marginal wells are not a marginal issue,"" says Adam Peltz, a director and senior attorney in the Environmental Defense Fund's energy program. He points toresearchfrom his group and others showing that marginal wells emit more methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than previously believed.
Methane, or natural gas, is often found in the same underground formations as oil. It's a valuable resource if it's kept in pipes, but if methane leaks out from wells or other equipment, it escapes into the atmosphere, where ittraps heatand contributes to a warming climate.
While low-volume wells produce about 6% of the country's fossil fuels, EDF's research published inNature Communicationssuggests they could be responsible for more like 50% of the methane emissions from ""upstream"" oil and gas. That's the pollution that comes from producing oil, not the emissions created when burning it. Areportcommissioned by the Department of Energy estimated marginal oil and gas wells release 40 to 60% of the industry's upstream emissions.
Methane pollution is uneven; some wells release a lot, and some release none. Robinowitz said that at Bird Creek, because of the nature of the geologic formation that these wells are tapping, there's ""very little gas"" left underground.
But marginal wells, as a class, are under scrutiny both because there are so many of them, and because monitoring for methane and investing in equipment to control leaks are expenses that, historically, marginal operators have often argued they can't afford. Under the Biden administration, rules and programs were designed to identify high-polluting wells and address them. The future of those rules under the Trump administration is unclear.
Kara Joy McKee, the Oklahoma director with the Sierra Club, notes that oil and gas is an important industry in her state. ""Almost everyone in Oklahoma has someone in their family working in oil and gas, or knows someone, loves someone working in oil and gas,"" she says. Any transition away from fossil fuels must take the livelihoods of all those workers into consideration, she says.
But she still thinks the economics of marginal wells don't balance out against their environmental and health risks.In addition to harming the climate, poorly maintained wells can also release hazardous air pollution and pollute waterways.
""These piddly little wells that are just drip-dropping out a little bit of profit while polluting on the other end — they're not worth it,"" she says. ""I get it wanting to squeeze every last little bit of profit out. But on the other side, the health costs to our society and the future costs to our world, are really way too high to pay.""
When there's no money left in keeping them open, marginal wells are supposed to be plugged — permanently closed up with cement. That protects the local air and water from pollutants, and stops methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere.
But it's expensive to plug a well, and sometimes, old wells just linger on. These are sometimes called ""idle"" wells, and they worry people like Peltz, because they could be a source of future emissions.
Producers often argue there are good reasons to let wells idle. Robinowitz, for instance, has about 55 wells operating in his Bird Creek field. He's plugged two or three, he says. Another 175 holes are sitting idle. They're not being used — but they're not permanently sealed, either.
Robinowitz doesn't see his idle wells as being at the end of their lives at all. He's adamant that they are potential future assets — that he could, someday, redevelop them. After all, technology changes. Injecting water squeezed out more oil for Texaco, horizontal drilling squeezed out more for him. Maybe future techniques could eke out even more.
""If it's plugged, it's forever gone,"" he says. ""You've spent the money and it's over.""
Peltz says it's true that some wells will come back, but says EDF's research suggests that's not the norm. ""What we've found is that generally wells, once they've been idled for let's say, more than three or five years … the vast majority of them never come back online,"" he says.
He advocates for policies that incentivize closing idle wells — or require companies to monitor them and to put aside enough money to plug them, even if those companies go bankrupt.
The most recent report from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency led by regulators from oil-producing U.S. states,foundthat from 2018 to 2020, oil and gas operators plugged some 62,000 wells.
But at the end of 2020, another 230,000 wells were idle.
This illustrates a long-standing tension over old oil wells: Are they fundamentally problems — a pollution risk and, eventually, a plugging cost? Or are they opportunities, as long as some valuable oil might conceivably be squeezed out?
Robinowitz doesn't deny climate science. He recognizes making oil and gas comes at an environmental cost — a cost whichisn'tfactored into the finances of these aging wells.
""I don't have enough perspective or true information to figure out what that cost is. But I understand that side of the argument,"" he says. ""I guess there's a middle ground that will be reached to support the reality of methane and to support the environment and also allow the [oil] industry to have a life.""
Scott Robinowitz keeps old pump jacks and other oilfield equipment in a yard at the Bird Creek field in Sperry, Okla.September Dawn Bottoms for NPRhide caption
But he also isn't the type of person to get rid of something that could still come in handy. At Bird Creek, he has a broad grassy field covered in old oilfield equipment. He chuckles when asked if it's a junkyard for parts. No, he says, he's confident he could get all those machines working again. Well, he hedges, ""95% of them.""
""My wife would come out every once in a while, and she'd be like, 'Wow, you got a lot of junk here,"" he says. ""And I'm like, 'Junk!? Stace, this is not junk! This helps support our college fund.""
It's the same with his fields of aging wells. Where others might see a problem being put off, he sees opportunity.

Power lines run near a bridge in Hamilton, Ontario, on Feb. 4. This week, Ontario's leader threatened a surcharge on Canadian electricity sold in some U.S. states in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption
Formore than a century, the U.S. and Canada have sold each other electricity through power lines that criss-cross the border, an arrangement that has historically hummed along thanks to the warm relationship between the two countries. That changed this week.
On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Fordannouncedthe province was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The move was in response to President Trump's tariffs on Canada.
Trump, a day later, saidhe would doubleU.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel to 50%. ""Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area?"" Trumpaskedin a separate post on his social media site.
Ultimately both sides backed down from their threats andagreed to meetto discuss trade issues. But the whirlwind episode highlighted the U.S. reliance on imported Canadian power — and the fact that some states obtain electricity from their northern neighbor.
Here's what to know about Canada, the U.S., and the electricity that zips across the border.
More than 30 major transmission linesconnectan array of nearby U.S. and Canadian cities and regions. The two countries evenoperate by the same setof reliability standards, despite the political boundary between them. A massive2003 blackoutcut power to some 50 million people on both sides of the border.
""You have cities and urban areas that are close neighbors, and you have electric systems that are close neighbors,"" said Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""There's sort of an imaginary line that runs between them called the border.""
Integrated power grids have several benefits, McGeady says. For one, a larger system is more resilient against disruptions and power outages.
Electricity is also cheaper in integrated grids. Power generators with the lowest prices will more easily find buyers in a larger electric system. ""There's a basic economic factor that drives grid integration everywhere,"" McGeady said.
Canadasaysit exports enough electricity to the U.S. to power more than 5.6 million homes.
While electricity shared across the borderrepresents less than 1%of the total power generated by both countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the trade is critical to ensuring that electric supply meets consumer demand.
In 2023, theU.S. bought$3.2 billion worth of electricity from Canada, while it sold Canada $1.2 billion in electricity, according to U.S. government data. U.S. states and regions near the border — such as New York, New England, the Midwest and the West Coast — typically buy the most Canadian electricity.
According to Seth Blumsack, an energy professor at Penn State University, U.S. electricity operators likely have enough short-term capacity to replace any Canadian power that is withheld or becomes too expensive to buy, but it may come from a different source.
""It's not like if the Canadian hydro imports get cut off, you're going to replace it with wind and solar in New England,"" Blumsack said. ""You're going to replace that with power plants in New England that are burning natural gas or fuel oil or some other fuel source that is going to increase carbon emissions and may also increase local air pollution.""
States such as New York and Massachusetts have tried to reduce their carbon emissions in part by buying Canadian electricity, which ismost commonly generatedthrough hydroelectric power. Trade disputes between the two countries could complicate those climate goals.
The recent spat over electricity sales has dimmed the once glowing relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which have both been boosted by the free trade of power, said Asa McKercher, a professor of U.S.-Canada relations at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.
""That's what makes this sort of tariff war really self-defeating for both countries, is the fact that we've benefited from access to cheap energy,"" he said.
McKercher said some Canadians have argued in the past that the country should export less of its energy to the U.S. and instead share it within its own borders. Those views had typically been dismissed, but more Canadians are coming around to the idea given Trump's recent attacks on the country, he added.
""Now those arguments are sort of returning again, and I think increasing numbers of Canadians are seeing some wisdom in those suggestions,"" McKercher said. ""The situation is kind of a reversal of a lot of past history, in which the trend has been towards integration of continental energy resources.""
In the short term, analysts say further disputes between the U.S. and Canada over electricity shared across the border will mean higher electric bills for consumers.
""It made economic sense to build these transmission lines and to move power back and forth across the border,"" McGeady said. ""If you disrupt that, the impact has to be upward pressure on prices and reduced reliability. That's what the fundamental risk is here.""

California Flats is a 2900 acre plot of land in central California that's covered in solar panels. The extra energy generated from all that solar flows straight into batteries right on site.
Batteries are everywhere. They're in our phones, our remote controls, smart-watches, electric cars and so much more. They could also be the solution to a problem that renewable energy companies have faced for years: How to store the mass amounts of energy they produce for later use.
Renewable energy has historically been at the whim of the weather. Solar power relies on sun exposure, and wind power requires the wind to blow. Ultimately, they're somewhat ephemeral. But what if companies could tap into all that energy they're harnessing whenever they need it?
Enter batteries.
In California, there's now enough grid-scale battery storage to power millions of homes for a few hours. Battery power is often the second largest source of energy on a given day in the state. So, we're digging into the fast-growing technology withThe Indicator from Planet MoneyproducerCooper Katz McKim,  who developed a three-part series on the technology.

DAMASCUS, Syria — At night, Damascus remains raucous as roadside vendors, motorbikes and traffic surge. Take just a few steps off the side of a highway bisecting the Syrian capital, however, and the night envelopes you. Most neighborhoods go dark at night because there is no electricity.
The darkness is emblematic of the myriad challenges facing Syria's new authorities, who last December toppled a regime controlled by the Assad family for 50 years. The new interim government needs to rebuild a country where large swaths of basic infrastructure and homes have been destroyed by war and neglect, and one of its most pressing challenges is also one of the most basic: keeping the lights on.
""The new boys are entering over a country that is at below zero and had nothing,"" says Samer Zaghloul, a resident of Damascus buying bread in the dark. He is referringtoHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the fighting group that is part of a coalition now governing parts of Syria. ""Whatever work they do, they are not going to be able to manage everything.""
Most Syrians still live in dimness. Syria's heavily damaged electrical grid and gas refineries cannot meet domestic demand, so the state rations power to just two hours of electricity a day.
Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, faces major challenges in providing power services to his war-ravaged country.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
Now, Syria's new coalition of leaders is trying to prove to Syria'sestimated 23 millioncitizens that it can provide services, like collect the trash and fix the electricity.
""We only generate 1,500 megawatts, which is not enough for the consumption for the people, so we are rationing and providing only two hours a day,""said Omar Shaqrouq, Syria's new electricity minister, in an interview in Damascus. In the next five years, he said, Syria is aiming to increase power capacity to 12,000 megawatts.
Much of Syria's power infrastructure, including its electrical grid and gas refineries, were destroyed during years of civil war. Although Syria once produced enough petroleum to be afuel-exporting powerhouse, toughinternational sanctionshavepreventedits export since 2011. (In January, the United States temporarilylifted sanctionson Syrian energy sales for six months.)
Shaqrouq also explained that the Assad regime struggled to maintain the electricity sector due to sanctions blocking access to spare parts. While these sanctions have been lifted, financial sanctions remain, hindering the foreign investment required to rehabilitate the electricity sector.

As its own fuel production dwindled, with most of the country's oil wealth under the control of theU.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominatedautonomous region in the northeast, Syriarelied on Iran, which used to provide the old Syrian regime crude oil. But Iran has refused to give the new leaders resources.
Low-level corruption further hampered management of Syria's aging power infrastructure. Shaqrouq says bureaucrats in the Assad regime failed to take basic precautions, like taking inventory of equipment, to prevent embezzlement, and they diverted some funds intended for power projects.
""Fifty years of theft is something very scary,"" says Ibrahim Alhudhud, a baker in Damascus, who says Syria's former leaders intentionally left his neighborhood without power in order to push residents to buy government-imported solar panels. He still runs the lights in his shop with a diesel-powered generator.
Small, battery-powered lights are popular in Damascus, Syria's capital, because buying fuel for generators can be expensive and because the generator fumes are smelly andare linkedto cancer risks. As a result, most residents simply accept the darkness.

Kholoud Ayoub, 62, is one such resident. She welcomesNPR into her dim apartment one night, smartphone light in hand. She gets power only once every seven to eight hours.
When the electricity comes on, she crams all her chores — the washing, cooking and ironing — into that one hour.
When asked what life would be like with reliable power, Ayoub sighs. ""Life would be more beautiful,"" she says. ""Electricity is life.""
With most electricity generation plants down, many restaurants and businesses in Damascus rely on noisy diesel-powered generators. The fuel to run them is also in short supply in Syria.
Shaqrouq, the electricity minister, said Syria's crude oil production capacity within HTS control has plummeted from 360,000 barrels a day to just 10,000 barrels a day.

Enterprising intermediaries fill up on fuel for generators just across the country's western border, in neighboring Lebanon.
From there, smugglers told NPR, the fuel is transported through private roads into Syria. This kind of cross-border commerce is a lifeline for Syria because of the sanctions.
""The items that are desperately needed — which is diesel, natural gas and gasoline — for the Syrian people are being transported from Lebanon to Syria,"" says Sheikh Ahmed Al-Sheikh, the mayor of a border village in Lebanon where many of the smugglers operate. ""They are just taking a truck full of diesel and driving into Syria normally with no one asking them any questions.""
Much of the fuel ends up on the sides of highways in Damascus, still in the same green plastic jerry cans — a cheaper fuel than the stuff sold at Syria's gas stations currently.
""This gas you see is from Lebanon,"" says Abdo Saadeldine, 23,one of the ubiquitous fuel resellers who have popped up all over Damascus since the fall of the old regime, pointing to dozens of green plastic jerry cans at his feet.
Abdo Saadeldine sells Lebanese gasoline on the streets of Damascus. Syrians buy fuel brought in from Lebanon because they say it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline.Ayman Oghanna for NPRhide caption
He says he sells Lebanese gasoline because it is higher quality and gentler on car engines than Syria's low-octane gasoline. Every day, Saadeldinesays, he sells about 20 to 25 gallons. Not a bad living, but this is just a side hustle, he says. His real passion is cutting hair.
""Love what you do to do what you love,"" he shrugs.
For now, a whole network of people like him is helping Syria's patchwork energy system run.
But if Syria's new leaders want to turn a page, they will need to move past relying on hairdressers-turned-gas sellers hawking smuggled fuel. They will need to rebuild — refineries, the power grid, indeed an entire country.

President Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders after his inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. He also declared a national energy emergency.Evan Vucci/APhide caption
President Trump declared anational energy emergencyas part of aflurry of executive ordersissued Monday. But the document is not an emergency forallforms of energy, it's mostly supporting the production of domestic fossil fuels.
""We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech and then later signed the emergency declaration and commented that it ""means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."" That is not accurate and many of the details for how this will be done are not included in the order.
Trump invoked presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act, which healso used in 2019to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. This gives the president more power to sidestep bureaucratic processes and public notifications. ABrennan Center analysis""identified 137 statutory powers that may become available to the president when he declares a national emergency.""
In this case those powers include suspending some environmental regulations under landmark laws such as the Endangered Species Act and speeding up energy project approval processes.
Trump's declaration doesn't lay out, specifically, what he wants done. Instead, he ""orders executive departments and agencies to identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them,"" says Amy Stein, a law professor at the University of Florida, who responded to NPR's questions by email.
In issuing the order for the emergency declaration, Trump said, ""The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy."" He blamed ""the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration.""
But indefining what constitutes ""energy""Trump left out two renewable forms — wind and solar power — which were a particular focus for the Biden administration's ambitious climate policies. Together they comprisemore than 14% of the country's electricity generation.
""It's striking that the emergency he seems to be declaring, is one of a lack of fossil fuel production,"" says Sam Sankar, an attorney and senior leader with Earthjustice. He says that's strange because ""the U.S. is currently producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet everhas in the history of human civilization.""
Trump's order doesn't mention the climate-heating effects of burning fossil fuels. Instead it says Americans are suffering from high energy prices. It also looks ahead to increasing electricity demand from technology, like artificial intelligence and says inadequate energy supplies ""poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.""
To fix that, Trump wants to cut regulations and speed up approval processes to deploy more oil drilling rigs, build more pipelines, and bring more power plants onto the grid.
Stein says key provisions in the emergency declaration include ordering departments and agencies to explore using federal land or eminent domain, which is when the government takes private property for public use with compensation. The goal, as Trump's order states, is ""to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources.""
Stein says the emergency declaration also authorizes special provisions to grant approvals for energy projects under several existing laws including the Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. She says it authorizes emergency consultation processes under the Endangered Species Act and construction authority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
One of the few checks on President Trump's emergency powers likely will come in the form of litigation. That won't happen until agencies determine what options are available.
""You can't challenge presidential statements or orders any more than you can challenge presidential speeches,"" Sankar says. ""So what matters is when things happen on the ground that actually affect people.""
He says one example could be if the Trump administration stops paying funds that were obligated under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. It provided hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives to encourage technologies that reduce or eliminate the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.
It's possible that challenges coming from this emergency declaration could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. That would provide answers to questions some have about the National Emergencies Act, such as what qualifies as an emergency.
""We actually have no case law in the United States about what constitutes an emergency and when it's appropriate to do it,"" says Soren Dayton, who is the director of governance at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. He expects either Trump's energy emergency or hismost recent southern border emergency declarationwill face a legal challenge.
Dayton welcomes that because he doesn't think complicated problems like energy production, climate change or immigration should be handled through presidential emergency declarations.
""These are hard things and I think you need to have politics over them — not to invest the presidency with this magic wand and say we can do all these things without any debate,"" Dayton says.

The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting formore than half of all new electricity on the gridlast year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth.
That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.
Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released apolicy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as ""energy dominance."" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has beenopenly hostile to renewable energy.
Trump has suggestedtariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S.With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.
Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation.
""We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,"" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free.
That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election.
""Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,"" Solares says.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though theU.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At aspeech to the Economic Club of New Yorkin September, Trump said he would ""rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act"" — that's theBiden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.
It's not clear what Trump's comments mean forclean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000.
""Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],"" Solares says, ""Otherwise it's just too expensive.""
It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes.
Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion.
""A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,"" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane.
Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses.
""I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun… You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,"" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.

Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond.
One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now.
""As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,"" says Doug Edwards, president ofExact Solaras he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation.
Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trumpcampaigned on putting 20% tariffson all goods coming into the U.S.
If that happens quickly — say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished — that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets.
Also in his warehouse there's black metal ""racking"" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade.
""We've almost tripled in size in the last few years — all local hiring, all local team members,"" Edwards says, ""And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.""
While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected.
Stephen Irvin withAmicus Solar Cooperativesays when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, ""that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.""
And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats.
""Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,"" Irvin says. ""Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.""
The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power.

MOSCOW — On the morning of Jan. 1, Russia pumped its last cubic meters of natural gas directly to Europe, ending decades of trade that had benefited all sides — and heated homes — through some of the darkest winters of the Cold War and well into the 21st century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine unraveled all of that.
After Moscow tampered with the flow to Europe as a response to Western sanctions in 2022, European economies raced to reduce their dependence on Russian gas amid fears they had traded cheap energy at the expense of security.
The Yamal-Europe pipeline through Belarus to Poland soon closed. Two others feeding Germany, Nord Stream and Nord Stream II, were destroyed by saboteurs under still-murky circumstances later that same year. All that was left was a pipeline named Druzhba, Russian for ""friendship,"" that ran through, of all places, Ukraine — a legacy of a less divided Europe that no longer exists.
Here is what to know about the gas cutoff.
For now, the crisis is focused in a region called Transnistria, located on the eastern edge of the former Soviet republic of Moldova. It's a sliver of territory with a population of some 360,000 bordering Ukraine that declared independence with the breakup of the USSR. It has been under Russian protection, including by Russian peacekeepers, ever since.
Transnistria's economy has always survived thanks to cheap Russian gas — and its energy-related problems have cascaded since the New Year's stoppage. There is no heat or hot water for residents. Nearly all factories have stopped operations. Schools and residential buildings have also gone cold — with residents told to dress warmly or gather firewood from nearby forests.

While the region's key power station has switched from gas to coal to continue service, supplies are limited. Meanwhile, the use of portable electric heaters has overstressed the power grid — with more than a hundred fires reported daily. As a result, the local self-proclaimed authorities have introduced rolling blackouts in increasing increments — hoping to avoid a full blackout.
Ukraine continued to honor a five-year preinvasion contract to export Russian gas through its territory to central Europe — with Russia's energy giant Gazprom raking in the proceeds and the Ukrainian government collecting transit fees. That came to an end Jan. 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the deal akin to blood money and vowed it wouldn't continue. Kyiv has celebrated the end of the transit deal as a major blow to Russia's economy — and its war machine.
""When Putin was presented with the Russian presidency more than 25 years ago, the annual gas transit through Ukraine to Europe totaled more than 130 billion cubic meters,"" Zelenskyywrote on the social platform X. ""Today, it equals 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats.""
No. Ukraine had signaled well in advance it had no intention of renewing the transit contract with Moscow so long as the war continued. Most of Europe had already shifted away from Russian gas — or had come up with alternative solutions, including imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
But some European countries remain bitter over the end of Russian gas. European Union member Slovakia, in particular, has accused Kyiv of ""sabotage"" and threatened to punish Ukraine over the loss of its own transit fees from the Russia-Ukraine agreement.
More vulnerable still? Moldova, which has its own ambitions of joining the EU.
Gas exports have long been a tool of Russian influence in Moldova, particularly at moments when the government in the capital Chisinau has pushed a distinctly pro-Western path.
And there are signs of politics once again at play.
Even before the end of the gas transit deal with Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom said it was suspending exports to Moldova over some$700 millionin unpaid gas supplies — a charge Moldova disputes.
And while Moldova had already taken steps to diversify its energy options, notably by importing gas and electricity from neighboring Romania, the breakaway region of Transnistria leaves it exposed on several fronts.
Transnistria's main power plant still provides electricity to significant parts of the rest of Moldova.
Moldova's government also openly accuses Russia of ""blackmail."" It argues that the Kremlin is hoping an energy crisis, and the accompanying humanitarian fallout in Transnistria, will undermine Moldova's pro-Western policies when the country holds parliamentary elections later this year. The Kremlin has denied the accusation.
Russia's Gazprom blamed Ukraine for its decision not to renew the transit deal, saying in a statement that it now lacked ""the technical and legal means"" to provide gas to its customers in Europe. The energy giant also continues to insist Moldova's outstanding debts make supplying the country by other circuitous routes — such as through a Russian-Turkish pipeline that tunnels under the Black Sea — untenable.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, however, has been more explicit in promoting a long-running Russian conspiracy theory: that the U.S. had orchestrated the whole thing at Europe and Russia's expense.
""The main beneficiary of the repartition of the energy market of the Old World is the main sponsor of the Ukrainian crisis — the United States,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharovawrote on social media.
""Now for the price of American protection, other countries in the once economically successful and independent European Union will be forced to pay.""

Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.Jimmy Carter Libraryhide caption
Former President Jimmy Carter at the June 20, 1979 dedication ceremony for solar panels installed on the White House.
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States,died at his home in Plains, Ga., on Sunday. He was 100.
Carter's interest in promoting renewable energy was on display at his January 20, 1977 presidential inauguration. Solar panels were installed to warm the reviewing stand near the White House, where Carter watched the inaugural parade.
""It happened to be one of the coldest days of the year that morning and very little sun,"" says Paul Muldawer, the Atlanta architect Carter tapped to design his inauguration facilities.
""We made a statement, although it honestly didn't work as well as I would have liked it to work,"" Muldawer says. Wind chill that day was in the teens, according to theNational Weather Service.
Carter wanted a ceremony that reflected his values. That extended to the reviewing stand, which was built so it wouldn't end up in a landfill after the ceremony. Instead of wood, it was made of steel.
""After the inauguration, we had it disassembled, shipped to Atlanta, and then it was recycled as a bandstand,"" says Muldawer, who's now 92. The structure was in a public park where free concerts were held. ""Carter was just thrilled with that. He really liked the idea of repurposing that facility.""

A peanut-shaped float passes by the Presidential reviewing stand for the inauguration of Jimmy Carter in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1977. The stand, instead of being sent to a landfill, was recycled and sent to Atlanta where it was used as a band stand for free public concerts.
The inauguration set the stage for Carter's four years as President. His environmental legacy has shaped how the country is responding to climate change today.
""At the time that Jimmy Carter was president, his biggest concern was energy security,"" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University.
In 1977, the U.S. was importing8.81 million barrelsof petroleum a day, mostly from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC cartel. That made the U.S. vulnerable during the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which led to long lines at gas stations.
In several ways Jaffe says Carter was ahead of his time by being an early advocate for conserving energy and boosting renewable electricity, such as solar power. But Carter also promoted domestic coal mining. The subsequent growth of that industry contributed to the warming climate the world is experiencing now.
Shortly after Carter took office in 1977, hedeliveredwhat has become known as the ""sweater speech."" Sitting by a lit fireplace, he wore a cardigan sweater and addressed the country on television.

President Jimmy Carter wears a sweater during a meeting with members of his cabinet at the White House, April 20, 1977. Carter encouraged Americans to turn down thermostats to save energy.
""All of us must learn to waste less energy. Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas,"" Carter said.
Energy efficiency seems like a given today, but it wasn't really on Americans' minds after the 1950s and '60s, Jaffe says. Back then, it seemed like the oil would always flow. Jaffe says some even made fun of Carter's efficiency plea — an indication of how unusual the request was at the time.
Still, energy experts then were thinking about the possibility that oil and gas could run out. That prompted Carter to encourage alternative sources of energy. ""He even put solar panels, famously, on the White House,"" Jaffe says.
At a press event unveiling the solar panels that would be used to heat water, Carter made clear that energy security was at the top of his mind.
""Today, in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels,"" Carter said.
By the end of the 20th century, Carter wanted the U.S. to get ""20% of all the energy we use from the sun."" The countrystill hasn't reached that goal, thoughmore than 80%of new generating capacity this year is expected to come from solar and battery storage.
As if to highlight the risk of experimenting with new energy sources, Carter told reporters at the solar panel unveiling, ""A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.""
The panelswere removedless than a decade later during the Reagan administration.
""Had the United States stayed the course, and we had not had volatility in our federal efforts in alternative energy, we would maybe still be the premier country for alternative energy,"" Jaffe says. Instead, she says, the U.S. is playing catch-up with countries like Denmark and Spain on wind energy, and China for solar and electric vehicles.
The panels removed from the White House were stored in a government warehouse until Unity College acquired them, according toMaine Public. Sixteen panels were re-installed on a roof at the college in Central Maine and used to heat water for the dining hall. One of the panels, about the size of a picnic table, is displayed on the campus with a marker describing its historical significance.

The summer after Carter took office, he received amemowith the subject ""Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change."" It warned that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a ""greenhouse effect"" that ""will induce a global climatic warming.""
The memo was from Frank Press, Carter's chief advisor on scientific matters and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press wrote, ""The present state of knowledge does not justify emergency action to limit the consumption of fossil fuels in the near term."" But he did write that considering the ""potential CO2 hazard"" should become part of the country's long-term energy strategy.
The top of the memo is marked ""THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."" Climate change, though, was not an issue Carter highlighted during his time in office. He actually boosted domestic coal production. Coal is the mostcarbon-intense fuelfor generating electricity.
Carter's1980 campaign speechto miners in West Frankfort, Illinois includes a level of boosterism rarely seen outside of the coal industry these days.
""America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal,"" Carter told miners and employees of the Old Ben Coal Mine No. 25. He also boasted that the country would, ""produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America.""
The greenhouse gas emissions from burning more coal are an issue the country still grapples with as the effects of climate change become clear.
""I calculated once that we had roughly five full extra years of emissions at roughly the 2000 level of CO2 emissions due to Carter's energy coal policies,"" says Philip Verleger, an economist who worked on energy issues in the Treasury Department during the Carter administration.
In a 1978 speech Carter did recognize the polluting nature of coal byannouncinga commission on the coal industry. ""Ultimately, we will learn to harness the energy of the Sun and the oceans with fusion power to meet our energy needs. But for now, we have no choice but to continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels, and coal is our most abundant fossil fuel,"" Carter said.
But even Verleger comes back to Carter's work advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy.
""Carter really started the ball rolling, created many of the ideas that are now coming to the fore. And that's good. The downside in terms of environment was the emphasis on coal,"" Verleger says.
Preserving land also was a priority for Carter. Near the end of his presidency, he signed into law theAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It provided protections for 157 million acres of land through the creation of national parks, refuges and conservation areas.
The legislation doubled the size of the National Park System and was the largest expansion of protected lands in history, according to theNational Park Service.

Carter alsosigned legislationin 1977 creating the Department of Energy, which is implementing much of the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed last year. The law dedicates money to boosting renewable energy and research on new technologies.
""Over four decades ago, Carter was putting in place policies that we are now enhancing today,"" Jaffe says. The IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing also is helping fulfill Carter's goal of putting ""the United States back to where it needs to be, and dominating supply chains for things like solar panels, manufacturing and electric cars,"" explains Jaffe.

In his final years, Carter's environmental legacy came full circle. In 2017 he leased 10 acres of his land in Plains, Georgia for a solar power project that produces enough electricity to supply about half the demand of his hometown.
At the dedication event he told the crowd, ""This site will be as symbolically important as the 32 panels we put on the White House,"" according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""People can come here and see what can be done.""

Gas utilities will have to check customer meters, like these in Darby, Pa., for leaks more frequently under proposed regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Jeff Brady/NPRhide caption
PHILADELPHIA â€” Melissa Ostroff finds gas leaks for a living, so it was surprising to hear someone say they smelled gas in her own home.
As part ofher job with the environmental group Earthworks, Ostroff searches gas drilling and production sites in Pennsylvania for plumes of methane, a big driver of climate change. A few years back, her family visited her south Philadelphia row home for the holidays.
""When my sister entered the house, she told me she smelled gas,"" Ostroff says. Knowing thatgas utility meters are a big source of leaks, that was the first place she examined with a device she uses for her job. ""There was a small but very continuous leak coming from a pipe fitting around the gas meter.""
Ostroff figures she had become accustomed to the odorant gas companies put in natural gas so customers will detect leaks. She called her utility, which fixed it right away. Aside from the safety concern, Ostroff knows that gas leaks are a problem for the climate. Methane is the main component of natural gas and, as one of the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Melissa Ostroff used an optical gas imaging camera to see a small methane leak from the gas meter in her basement.Earthworkshide caption
Now,under proposed federal regulations, gas utilities would have to find and fix more leaks like this. At the end of his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump signed an appropriations bill that included the new requirement. The Biden administration is finishing the rules to implement the law. In the past, utilities focused this work on safety and preventing explosions that hurt people and damage property. Under the new rules, they'll also have to consider environmental harm when searching for methane leaks.
You can't see methane, but a special infrared camera can. These costs thousands of dollars. Ostroff had one in her home because that's what she uses to find plumes at drilling sites. Now, she periodically checks the meter for leaks and says the problem appears to be fixed.

Customer gas meters are the largest source of methane that escapes in the atmosphere from gas distribution systems. But leaks like this are not common. An industry study from GTI Energy showed less than 1% of indoor meters leak. But there are a lot of meters in the country, and it's easy tofind customers online who say they've experienced leaks. Outdoor meters are less of a risk for causing explosions because the methane disperses into the atmosphere. But there, methane becomes a problem for the climate.
The new gas leak rules have been drafted by federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates gas utility pipelines and other infrastructure, all the way up to and including customer meters. Because safety was the focus in the past, utilities detected some leaks, but they didn't reach the top of the repair list for years.
""I've found like 10-year-old leaks,"" says Erin Murphy, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund. ""So they've known about this pipeline leak for 10 years and haven't fixed it because they're not required to.""
PHMSA's proposed regulations that apply to gas meters are part of a larger group of regulations intended to reduce methane pollution from natural gas pipelines. The new rules are not as strict as Murphy would like, but she says they're an improvement.
""In the proposed rule, PHMSA would require operators to conduct more frequent leak surveys, to use more advanced technologies in those surveys, and to fix the leaks that they find more quickly,"" Murphy says.
Gas utilities say they already were reducing methane pollution. Their main trade group, American Gas Association (AGA), saysmethane emissions from utilities are down 70% since 1990. Still, they say they are generally supportive of PHMSA's proposed rules and the law requiring them.
""It makes a heck of a lot of sense for us to codify something that, frankly, we're all kind of doing already,"" says Erin Kurilla, executive vice president at the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents publicly owned utilities.
The APGA, AGA and related trade associations filed77 pages of comments and suggestions on the proposed rule, but Kurilla characterizes most of the areas of contention as ""paperwork provisions.""
""We like where PHMSA is headed. We think methane reduction is important,"" says Lloyd Yates, president and CEO of the Indiana-based utility company NiSource. He also chairs AGA's board of directors. He does have questions about how much the new regulations will cost. ""As you try and drive methane down, you spend more money on that and you got to do this in a way that's affordable for customers.""
Given this general support from the industry, most people interviewed for this story don't expect big changes to these regulations from the incoming Trump administration, which didn't respond to a request for comment. The rules could be finalized as early as next month.

Three Mile Island was closed because it wasn't economical to operate. Now Microsoft wants it restarted in the hopes it can one day supply carbon-free energy for its datacenters.
Artificial intelligence uses a lot of power.
Some of the next generation data centers may use as much power as one million U.S. households.
Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this massive energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of powerwithoutproducing greenhouse gas emissions.
But while Silicon Valley tends to ""move fast and break things,"" nuclear power has a reputation for moving slowly. That's because in the nuclear energy field, ""breaking things"" can mean catastrophic damage. That makes some long-time watchers of the nuclear industry skeptical that it's the right investment for big tech companies to make.

Editor's note:This story is part of a series on Ukraine's energy industry under attack.Click here for a photo essay from Ukrainian coal country.
AT A UKRAINIAN POWER PLANT — Donning hard hats and thick uniforms, Lesia and Nadia sweep pulverized concrete out of a dark, broken room inside the thermal power plant where they've worked for years.
The women normally would be operating the conveyor belt that delivers coal, Ukraine's primary fuel source, to the plant's furnace. Instead they are clearing the conveyor belt's remains after a Russian missile attack earlier this year.
""I did not think this would ever be a dangerous job,"" Nadia says.
""We love our work,"" Lesia adds, ""but we have a constant feeling of fear.""
Lesia used to operate the conveyor belt at a Ukrainian energy station that brings coal to the plant's furnaces. Now she clears the belt's wreckage as a new one is built. She has survived three rocket strikes on the plant. ""We have a constant feeling of fear,"" she says.Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Lesia remembers the day of the attack, how everyone ran to the bomb shelter as the air raid siren blared.
""We stayed there a long time, like three hours,"" she says. ""We hoped the missile would hit somewhere else. But it came right at our plant. We heard the explosions from the shelter.""
For months now, she and her colleagues have returned to the plant every day to fix it and help keep the lights and heat on as winter sets in.
This plant is owned by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy supplier. It says Russia has attacked its facilities nearly 200 times since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Much of the company's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The company requested that NPR not disclose either the plant's location or the last names of workers to avoid giving Russian forces any information that might help target the energy company workers and facilities.
Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid have been so frequent this year that they have knocked out more than half of Ukraine's energy-generating capacity. On Nov. 28, after Russia's 11th mass attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year, Russian President Vladimir Putinthreatened to strike againwith a new ballistic missile that has nuclear capabilities.

To cope with the attacks, Ukraine has turned toemergency imports of electricity from neighboring countriesand enacted rolling blackouts. Homes and businesses have backup generators on hand.
In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Yevhen Hutman, a 40-year-old investment analyst for startups, says most people are prepared for power outages.
""Nobody wants this tough winter,"" he says. ""We have our power banks. We have all the stuff we need to, for example, work from home. But yeah, it's tiring.""
Anastasiia Shalukina, a 25-year-old nonprofit worker, has backup power at home and carries a tourniquet when she goes out due to frequent attacks.
""When I'm going abroad, when I hear fireworks,"" she says, ""I [get] a panic attack.""
The power plant NPR is visiting has already been attacked several times, according to plant manager Oleksandr.
""There was a lot of panic the first time,"" he says. ""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this. After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""
Oleksandr walks us through the vast grounds of the plant on a chilly, rainy day. Everyone is busy repairing something or clearing parts of buildings damaged by Russian strikes. There are teams on cranes, and crews on the muddy ground.
""We are civilians, we aren't trained to deal with this,"" says Oleksandr, the plant manager at a Ukrainian power station. ""After the first couple of strikes, though, it became clear that this was not going to end, and we had to get used to it.""Simona Supino for NPRhide caption
Vasyl, another manager, who is in charge of repairs, sidesteps a pile of crushed bricks and says that his team had only been trained for routine maintenance.
""Now they mainly fix or replace equipment damaged by missiles,"" he says. ""Boilers, turbines, generators, and also equipment that provides fuel supply. All this needs to be restored.""
His staff, he says, is learning as they go, following safety precautions in case something collapses.

""We restored and replaced all those wires there,"" he says, pointing. ""You can see the new ones. Everything was damaged when the missile exploded overhead.""
This scene is playing out at power plants all over Ukraine. Energy officials say the damage likely would have been much worse if Ukraine didn't have support from allies like the European Union and the United States.
In October, EU lawmakers approvedloaning Ukraine35 billion euros ($38 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian central bank assets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that one of his top priorities was to rebuild Ukraine's energy network.
The EU and the U.S. have also donated air defense systems that shoot down Russian drones and missiles.
Meanwhile, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-run energy company, has used materials like concrete and rebar supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development to build shelters shielding the most critical energy equipment. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who hastraveledto Ukraine several times since Russia's 2022 invasion, examined one of these structures during a visit in October.
""What we have learned over this very difficult wartime period is that there is no panacea for Putin's brutality, no inoculation,"" she told NPR then.
""But if something slips past air defense, if the Ukrainians are not able to shoot down a drone or a missile, this type of physical protection — the concrete, the rebar, the mesh — has made a profound difference in keeping energy online,"" she added.
It's not clear the U.S. will continue supporting Ukraine once the Trump administration takes office. President Biden is trying to push through as much Ukraine aid as possible before his term ends.

In a Septemberreportby the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Ukraine had already lost about 70% of its thermal generation capacity since this spring due to Russian strikes or occupation.

DiXi, a Ukrainian energy analytics group,predicts blackoutscould last up to 20 hours a day if this winter is especially harsh.
Meanwhile, the EU and U.S. recently earmarked acombined $112 millionin energy equipment and building for DTEK, the private Ukrainian power company. The aid is supposed to help Ukraine continue to weather Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, the most recent of which was on Nov. 17.
""No country in modern times has faced such an onslaught against its energy system,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said in a statement. ""But with the help of our partners we continue to stand strong against Russia's energy terror.""

An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines in October 2023 in Nolan, Texas. The U.S. oil industry is headed towards a record-breaking year; renewable energy has also set several records this year. Prominent Republicans, including several in President-elect Donald Trump's circle, are talking about an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy that supports fossil fuel and clean energy.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption
President-elect Donald Trump talks a lot about ""unleashing American energy"" — specifically oil, which he likes to call ""liquid gold.""
And based on his nominees for key energy posts, there's every indication that a Trump administration 2.0 will actively promote oil and natural gas.
But another phrase is popping up a lot right now in Republican circles: ""All of the above."" Trump's pick for ""energy czar,"" who has a history of supporting both oil and renewables, has been described as an ""all-of-the-above energy governor."" A key Republican in Congress hopes thatChris Wright, Trump's choice to be the new secretary of energy and a believer in fracking, nuclear and geothermal energy, willsupport""an all-of-the-above energy policy.""Statementafterstatement,storyafterstory. Even the summer before the election, the phrase wasreportedlythe talk of the Republican National Convention.
It's shorthand for a set of policies that support oil and natural gas — and simultaneously, every other form of domestic energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear. The phrase has been around for decades. Itappears to have been first promoted by the fossil fuel lobbybefore beingembraced by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. For Obama, the phrase meant supporting natural gas and pursuing cheap gasoline while also investing in renewable power. Today, it's amainstream Republican positionon energy.
President Biden,some argue, also supported ""all of the above"" in practice — although he didn't use the phrase. But he only supported it in the near term. For the long term, he promoted green energyinstead offossil fuels, talking about a ""clean energy transformation"" that would remake the economy and address the climate crisis by gradually phasing out oil.
In contrast, the version of ""all of the above"" being talked about in conservative circles today asserts that oil is here to stay — but it leaves room for cleaner energy, too.
Trump has promised to ""drill, baby, drill,"" but presidents in the U.S. don't dictate oil production. They can try to influence it, but market forces still dominate companies' decision-making. Case in point: Biden tried to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels, but under his administration U.S. oil production hitnew record highs.
The American Petroleum Institute has presented Trump with apolicy wish listfor the industry, including many things that the president-elect has promised to do, like rolling back incentives for producing and buying electric vehicles, restarting permitting for liquid natural gas exports, opening up more land for drilling for oil, and repealing or relaxing environmental regulations.
Those changes might make it easier and cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to drill for oil. But they won't guarantee a massive increase in production. After all, U.S. production is already historically high. Global oil demand is far from booming. In fact, the oil cartel OPEC and its allies justdelayed plans to boost production, judging that the world doesn't need more oil at the moment. After all, if production suddenly surges beyond what global markets demand, prices would fall — which would, in turn, cause companies to pull back on drilling.
That's a scenario investors and executives are eager to avoid. Wall Street has spent several yearspressuring companiesto focus less on ""drill, baby, drill,"" and more on a strategy you might call ""dollars, baby, dollars"" — sending spare cash back to stockholders, instead of deploying as many rigs as possible.
So, with financial incentives to keep production growth in check, how muchwouldproduction increase if Trump enacts these oil-friendly policies?
In an interview with NPR, Thomas Pyle, who runs athink tanksupporting free-market energy policy and was part of Trump's transition team in his first administration, rejected the question entirely.
""I don't know and I don't care,"" he said. ""The industry should make those decisions based on the marketplace. … To me, it's not about producing more. It's about giving the industry the ability to make those choices free from the hammer of the regulations.""
The Biden administration just spent four years offering billions of dollars in federal support to the clean energy industry, as part of an effort to slash U.S. carbon emissions and help curb the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Meanwhile, Trumpdismissesclimate changeas a hoax. Suffice to say that ""clean energy"" or ""green energy,"" defined by its climate benefits, won't be a priority for the administration.
But under a different name, the same climate-friendly energy technologies might still thrive. That's because alternative energy sources have other selling points for a Republican administration: They're domestic, which keeps the U.S. less dependent on foreign imports. They support jobs. And wind and solar, in particular, are also now huge industries in states with Republican governments, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, which has shifted some of the politics around their support.
Kennedy Nickerson focuses on energy policy for Capstone Consulting Group. She said some renewable projects,like offshore wind developments, will be set back by Trump's policies, but others could still advance.
""There will be a lot of marketing activities going on, I think, in order to kind of rebrand renewables from a climate tech [into] an energy security, energy dominance viewpoint that I think could get a lot of Republicans on board,"" she said.
Wright, Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has openly called for a rebranding, arguing that no energy is ""clean"" at all. ""We want new energies, but let's just be honest,"" he said in a talk this summer. ""Let's call them alternative energies or new energies — don't call them clean energy.""
And those in the green industry business are prepared for a reframing. Abigail Ross Hopper, who leads the Solar Energy Industries Association, emphasized U.S. jobs and energy security in a press call this month – calling that a narrative that ""translates across political parties.""
Hopper noted that something important is changing: Demand for electricity is soaring, thanks to AI data centers and new factories.
""This is not a time to choose between technologies,"" she said. ""This is the time to expand and increase our energy dominance across the portfolio and across the world.""
And meeting that demand with renewables will be less expensive than it was during past administrations. Today, solar and wind power are typicallycheaperthan fossil fuels.Paired with batteries, they can provide around-the-clock power — and the cost of batterieshas plummeted, too.
The economic case for renewables being cheaper ""was not quite there during President Obama's time,"" says Arun Majumdar, the dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a senior official at the Department of Energy during Obama's administration. Instead, renewables were pricey — a major reason why both Obama and, later, Biden, pursued policies designed to help bring the costs down over time.
""At the end of the day, what is cheaper really matters,"" Majumdar says.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he picked oil executive Chris Wright to be the secretary of energy, a role in which he's likely to promote fossil fuel development and reverse many Biden-era initiatives.
""As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'"" Trump said in a statement.
Trump added that Wright will also serve as part of a new Council of National Energy, which the president-elect unveiled on Friday, saying that it ""will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.""
Trump selected North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as the head of the Council of National Energy as well as hispick to be interior secretary.
Wright is the chief executive of oil and natural gas fracking services company Liberty Energy and sits on the board of a nuclear reactor company,according to his biographyon Liberty's website.
He has strongly advocated for the need for more fossil fuels, putting him in line with Trump's repeated call for more oil production.
Wright has also expressed doubts about whether climate change is driving extreme weather events.
""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in avideo uploaded to LinkedIn.
""We have seen no increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods despite endless fear mongering of the media, politicians and activists,"" he also said in the video. ""The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.""
That contradicts the U.S. government's ownNational Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is increasing ""the frequency and severity of many types of extreme weather events,"" including contributing to more intense hurricanes, heat waves and flooding.
A major environmental advocacy group sharply criticized Trump's pick of Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy.
""Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council in an emailed statement. ""Putting a champion of dirty fossil fuels in as the leader of the department would be a disastrous mistake.""
The Department of Energy wasfounded in 1977, in the aftermath of the oil crisis, bringing nuclear weapons programs and energy-related programs under one umbrella. Its network of national laboratories conducts a wide array of scientific research.
Under Biden, the DOE has pushed for the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy, withambitious goalsfor using 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The agency has also promoted energy efficiency, zero-carbon transportation and power grid improvements.
The DOE has deployed billions of dollars to pursue those goals — money approved by Congress, but actually distributed by the department.
Trump and his allies have opposed many of these spending measures, calling them wasteful, and either dismissed or deprioritized efforts to fight climate change, suggesting a radically reshaped DOE in the future.
One major question to be answered in the coming months is how much of this congressionally allocated spending the incoming administration may be able to nix or claw back — and which types of funding might have enough Republican support to survive.
The nomination will require confirmation from the Senate, where Republicans are poised to hold a majority of seats next year.

Oil and gas companies would have to pay a fee for releasing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere under new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. But it's likely the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will try to weaken or eliminate the fees.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it is also produced when extracting crude oil. Methane is among the greenhouse gasses heating the planet,and it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Scientific studiesshow the oil and gas industry releases about three times more methane than EPA estimates have shown. Methane leaks happen across the oil and gas production system, from drilling to transporting the fossil fuels.Sometimes, the methane is released intentionally.
""EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel — instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,"" Michael Regan, EPA administrator said in a statement.
Thefees are laid out in President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA says they apply ""only to waste emissions from high-emitting oil and gas facilities,"" which means those under allowed limits do not have to pay fees. Violators would have to pay $900 a metric ton for anything released above the allowed limit. In two years, the fee would increase to $1,500 a metric ton.
The agency estimates the new fees will reduce methane emissions by 1.2 million metric tons through 2035 – ""the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.""
The EPA says the fees are designed to work in tandem withrules finalized last yearthat reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Republican-led states and industry groups already are challenging those regulations in court. The Supreme Court recentlydeclined a request to block themfrom taking effect
But under President-elect Donald Trump, the future of the rules are in doubt, and the oil industry says it will work to make sure they are changed or even eliminated.
""This is the wrong approach on methane policymaking,"" Mike Sommers with the American Petroleum Institute said in a call with reporters. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on repealing the regulation as quickly as possible.""
Some in the industry dubbed the fees a ""methane tax"" and vow to eliminate them.
""The tax will lead to less energy security and higher energy prices for American families and businesses,"" Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council said, calling on the Trump administration and Congress ""to repeal this punitive tax on American energy.""
While the fees may increase industry costs, the prices consumers pay are set by markets that include many more factors in addition to regulatory costs.The Trump campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the fees.
One option for changing the methane fee regulation might be theCongressional Review Act, which allows Congress ""to overturn certain federal agency actions."" It's also likely the fees will face a legal challenge from states and industry groups who allege the EPA is overstepping its authority.
Environmental groups praised the Biden administration for the new fees.
""It's heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,"" Maggie Coulter with the Center for Biological Diversity said. ""Ultimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction.""
The fees come as the Biden administration convened a summit with China at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, COP29, in Azerbaijan to reduce methane emissions and other climate pollutants globally. This was a follow-up to theGlobal Methane Pledgelaunched last year at COP28, when more than 150 countries pledged toreduce methane pollution by at least 30%by the end of the decade.
""The American people value clean air and healthy communities,"" Christina Deconcini with the World Resources Institute wrote in a statement. ""If Donald Trump attempts to rescind the rule when he takes office, he would be putting Americans at risk.""
